# MongoSessionStore

## Description

MongoSessionStore is a collection of Rails-compatible session stores for MongoMapper and Mongoid, but also included is a generic Mongo store that works with any (or no!) Mongo ODM.

## Usage

MongoSessionStore is compatible with Rails 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mongo_mapper" # or "Mongoid," or another Mongo ODM, or nothing
gem "mongo_session_store-rails3"
```

In the session_store initializer (config/initializers/session_store.rb):

```ruby
# MongoMapper
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_mapper_store

# Mongoid
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongoid_store

# anything else
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_store
MongoStore::Session.database = Mongo::Connection.new.db('my_app_development')
```

Note: If you choose to use `:mongo_store` you only need to set its database if you aren't using MongoMapper or Mongoid in your project.

By default, the sessions will be stored in the "sessions" collection in MongoDB.  If you want to use a different collection, you can set that in the initializer:

```ruby
MongoSessionStore.collection_name = "client_sessions"
```

And if for some reason you want to query your sessions:

```ruby
# MongoMapper
MongoMapperStore::Session.where(:updated_at.gt => 2.days.ago)

# Mongoid
MongoidStore::Session.where(:updated_at.gt => 2.days.ago)

# Plain old Mongo
MongoStore::Session.where('updated_at' => { '$gt' => 2.days.ago })
```

## Performance

The following is the benchmark run with bson_ext installed.  Without bson_ext, speeds are about 10x slower.  The benchmark saves 2000 sessions (~12kb each) and then finds/reloads each one.

      Average object size: 11824.462
              Index sizes: {"_id_"=>204800}

## Development

To run all the tests:

    rake

To switch to the Gemfile.lock for a certain Rails version:

    rake use_rails_30
    rake use_rails_31
    rake use_rails_32

To run the tests for a specific store:

    MONGO_SESSION_STORE_ORM=mongo_mapper bundle exec rspec spec
    MONGO_SESSION_STORE_ORM=mongoid bundle exec rspec spec
    MONGO_SESSION_STORE_ORM=mongo bundle exec rspec spec
