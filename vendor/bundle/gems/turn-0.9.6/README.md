# TURN - MiniTest Reporters
    by Tim Pease
    http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/turn


## DESCRIPTION:

TURN is a new way to view test results. With longer running tests, it
can be very frustrating to see a failure (....F...) and then have to wait till
all the tests finish before you can see what the exact failure was. TURN
displays each test on a separate line with failures being displayed
immediately instead of at the end of the tests.

If you have the 'ansi' gem installed, then TURN output will be displayed in
wonderful technicolor (but only if your terminal supports ANSI color codes).
Well, the only colors are green and red, but that is still color.

## FEATURES:

General usage provides better test output. Here is some sample output:


    TestMyClass
        test_alt                                                            PASS
        test_alt_eq                                                         PASS
        test_bad                                                            FAIL
            ./test/test_my_class.rb:64:in `test_bad'
            <false> is not true.
        test_foo                                                            PASS
        test_foo_eq                                                         PASS
    TestYourClass
        test_method_a                                                       PASS
        test_method_b                                                       PASS
        test_method_c                                                       PASS
    ============================================================================
      pass: 7,  fail: 1,  error: 0
      total: 15 tests with 42 assertions in 0.018 seconds
    ============================================================================


Turn also provides solo and cross test modes when run from the *turn* commandline
application.

## INSTRUCTION:

Turn can be using from the command-line or via require. The command-line tool
offers additional options for how one runs tests.

### Command Line

You can use the *turn* executable in place of the *ruby* interpreter.

    $ turn -Ilib test/test_all.rb

This will invoke the ruby interpreter and automatically require the turn
formatting library. All command line arguments are passed "as is" to the
ruby interpreter.

To use the solo runner.

    $ turn --solo -Ilib test/

This will run all tests in the test/ directory in a separate process.
Likewise for the cross runner.

    $ turn --cross -Ilib test/

This will run every pairing of tests in a separate process.

### Require

Simply require the TURN package from within your test suite.

    $ require 'turn/autorun'

This will configure MiniTest to use TURN formatting for displaying test
results. A better line to use, though, is the following:

    begin; require 'turn/autorun'; rescue LoadError; end

When you distribute your code, the test suite can be run without requiring
the end user to install the TURN package.

For a Rails application, put the require line into the 'test/test_helper.rb'
script. Now your Rails tests will use TURN formatting.

<b>Note:</b> This changed in version 0.9. It used to be just `require 'turn'`,
but because of how `bundle exec` works, it was better to require a subdirectory
file.

### Configuration

You can use `Turn.config` to adjust turn configuration.

Options are following:

    tests           List of file names or glob patterns of tests to run. Default: ["test/**/{test,}*{,test}.rb"]
    exclude         List of file names or globs to exclude from tests list. Default: []
    pattern         Regexp pattern that all test names must match to be eligible to run. Default: /.*/ (all)
    matchcase       Regexp pattern that all test cases must match to be eligible to run. Default: nil (all)
    loadpath        Add these folders to the $LOAD_PATH. Default: ['lib']
    requires        Libs to require when running tests. Default: []
    format          Reporter type (:pretty, :dot, :cue, :marshal, :outline, :progress). Default: :pretty
    live            Test against live install (i.e. Don't use loadpath option). Default: false
    verbose         Verbose output? Default: false
    trace           Number of backtrace lines to display. Default: set from ENV or nil (all)
    natural         Use natural language case names.  Default: false
    ansi            Force colorized output (requires 'ansi' gem). Default: set from ENV or nil (auto)

To set option just call the desired method:

    Turn.config.format = :progress

Also, you can use following environment variables to adjust settings:

    backtrace       Number of backtrace lines to display. Default: set from ENV or nil
    ansi            Force colorize output (requires 'ansi' gem).


## REQUIREMENTS:

* ansi 1.1+ (for colorized output and progress bar output mode)


## INSTALLATION:

Follow the ususal procedure:

    $ gem install turn
