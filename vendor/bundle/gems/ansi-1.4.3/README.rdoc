== DESCRIPTION

The ANSI project is a collection of ANSI escape code related libraries
enabling ANSI code based colorization and stylization of output.
It is very nice for beautifying shell output.

This collection is based on a set of scripts spun-off from
Ruby Facets. Included are Code (used to be ANSICode), Logger,
ProgressBar and String. In addition the library includes
Terminal which provides information about the current output
device.


== FEATURES

* ANSI::Code provides ANSI codes as module functions.
* String#ansi makes common usage very easy and elegant.
* ANSI::Mixin provides an alternative mixin (like +colored+ gem).
* Very Good coverage of standard ANSI codes.
* Additional clases for colorized columns, tables, loggers and more.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

There are a number of modules and classes provided by the ANSI
package. To get a good understanding of them it is best to pursue 
the QED documents[http://github.com/rubyworks/ansi/tree/master/qed/]
or the API documentation[http://rubyworks.github.com/ansi/api/index.html].

At the heart of all the provided libraries lies the ANSI::Code module
which defines ANSI codes as constants and methods. For example:

  require 'ansi/code'

  ANSI.red + "Hello" + ANSI.blue + "World"
  => "\e[31mHello\e[34mWorld"

Or in block form.

  ANSI.red{ "Hello" } + ANSI.blue{ "World" }
  => "\e[31mHello\e[0m\e[34mWorld\e[0m"

The methods defined by this module are used throughout the rest of
the system.


== INSTALLATION

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ sudo gem install ansi

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download[http://github.com/rubyworks/ansi/download] the tarball package and type:

  $ tar -xvzf ansi-1.0.0.tgz
  $ cd ansi-1.0.0
  $ sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.
