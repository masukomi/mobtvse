= unidecode

A library for transliteratively converting UTF-8 text to US-ASCII.

= Usage

  require "rubygems"
  require "unidecode"
  
  puts "Михаил Горбачёв".to_ascii # => "Mikhail Gorbachiov"

= Requirements

Just regular, ol' Ruby with the standard YAML library.

= Note

This code is a Ruby port of Sean M. Burke's Perl library Text::Unidecode,
http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-0.04/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm. The same caveats,
notes, and constraints listed there apply here though the Ruby implementation here is
slightly different, specifically the addition of String#to_ascii.

You can contact me via email (mailto:rsl@luckysneaks.com) or the Google Group I've set up

= Thanks

Thanks to Brian Cully <bjc@kublai.com> and RubyPanther for all their patience
and assistance.
