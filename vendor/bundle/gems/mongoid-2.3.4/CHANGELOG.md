### New Features

* Mongoid now supports basic localized fields, storing them under the covers as a
  hash of locale => value pairs. `field :name, localize: true`

* \#1275 For applications that default safe mode to true, you can now tell a
  single operation to persist without safe mode via #unsafely:
  `person.unsafely.save`, `Person.unsafely.create`. (Matt Sanders)

* \#1256 Mongoid now can create indexes for models in Rails engines. (Caio Filipini)

* \#1228 Allow pre formatting of compsoite keys by passing a block to #key.
  (Ben Hundley)

* \#1222 Scoped mass assignment is now supported. (Andrew Shaydurov)

  of #timeless: `person.timeless.save`, `Person.timeless.create(:title => "Sir")`.

* \#1103 Allow developers to create their own custom complex criteria. (Ryan Ong)

* Mongoid now includes all defined fields in `serializable_hash` and `to_json`
  results even if the fields have no values to make serialized documents easier
  to use by ActiveResource clients.

* Support for MongoDB's $and operator is now available in the form of:
  `Criteria#all_of(*args)` where args is multiple hash expressions.

* \#1250, \#1058 Embedded documents now can have their callbacks fired on a parent
  save by setting `:cascade_callbacks => true` on the relation.
  (pyromanic, Paul Rosania, Jak Charlton)

### Major Changes

* \#1288, \#1289 _id and updated_at should not be part of versioned attributes.

* \#1273 Mongoid.preload_models now checks if preload configuration option is set,
  where Mongoid.load_models always loads everything. (Ryan McGeary)

* \#1244 Has one relations now adhere to default dependant behaviour.

* \#1225 Fixed delayed persistence of embedded documents via $set.

* \#1166 Don't load config in Railtie if no env variables defined. (Terence Lee)

* Deleting versions created with `Mongoid::Versioning` no longer fires off
  dependent cascading on relations.

## 2.2.3 \[ In Development \] \[ Branch: 2.2.0-stable \]

## 2.2.2

* This release removes the restriction of a dependency on 1.3.x of the mongo
  ruby driver. Users may now use 1.3.x through 1.4.x.

## 2.2.1

  (Scott Ellard)

  return nil if field doesn't exist or have values.

* \#1193, \#1271 Always return Integers for integer fields with .000 precisions,
  not floats.

* \#1272 Don't modify configuration options in place when creating replica set
  connections.

## 2.2.0

### New Features

* Mongoid now contains eager loading in the form of `Criteria#includes(*args)`.
  This works on has_one, has_many, belongs_to associations and requires the identity map to
  be enabled in order to function. Set `identity_map_enabled: true` in your
  `mongoid.yml`. Ex: `Person.where(title: "Sir").includes(:posts, :game)`

* Relations can now take a module as a value to the `:extend` option. (Roman
  Shterenzon)

* Capped collections can be created by passing the options to the `#store_in`
  macro: `Person.store_in :people, capped: true, max: 1000000`

* Mongoid::Collection now supports `collection.find_and_modify`

* `Document#has_attribute?` now aliases to `Document#attribute_present?`

* \#930 You can now turn off the Mongoid logger via the mongoid.yml by
doing `logger: false`

* \#909 We now raise a `Mongoid::Errors::Callback` exception if persisting with
a bang method and a callback returns false, instead of the uninformative
validations error from before.

### Major Changes

* \#1173 has_many relations no longer delete all documents on a set of the relation
 (= [ doc_one, doc_two ]) but look to the dependent option to determine what
 behaviour should occur. :delete and :destroy will behave as before, :nullify and
 no option specified will both nullify the old documents without deleting.

* \#1142, \#767 Embedded relations no longer immediately persist atomically
when accessed via a parent attributes set. This includes nested attributes setting
and `attributes=` or `write_attributes`. The child changes then remain dirty and
atomically update when save is called on them or the parent document.

### Resolved Issues

* \#1190 Fixed the gemspec errors due to changing README and CHANGELOG to markdown.

* \#1180, \#1084, \#955 Mongoid now checks the field types rather than if the name
contains `/id/` when trying to convert to object ids on criteria.

* \#1176 Enumerable targets should always return the in memory documents first,
when calling `#first`

* \#1175 Make sure both sides of many to many relations are in sync during a create.

* \#1172 Referenced enumerable relations now properly handle `#to_json`
(Daniel Doubrovkine)

* \#1040 Increased performance of class load times by removing all delegate calls
to self.class.

## 2.1.9

* \#1154 Don't delete many-to-many documents on empty array set.

* \#1153 Retain parent document reference in after callbacks.

* \#1151 Fix associated validation infinite loop on self referencing documents.

* \#1150 Validates associated on `belongs_to` is `false` by default.

* \#1149 Fixed metadata setting on `belongs_to` relations.

* \#1145 Metadata inverse should return `nil` if `inverse_of` was set as `nil`.

* \#1139 Enumerable targets now quack like arrays.

* \#1136 Setting `belongs_to` parent to `nil` no longer deletes the parent.

* \#1120 Don't call `in_memory` on relations if they don't respond to it.

* \#1075 Set `self` in default procs to the document instance.

* \#1072 Writing attributes for nested documents can take a hash or array of hashes.

* \#990 Embedded documents can use a single `embedded_in` with multiple parent definitions.

## 2.1.8

* \#1110, \#1115 Don't memoize metadata related helpers on documents.

* \#1112 `db:create_indexes` no longer indexes subclasses multiple times.

* \#1111, \#1098 Don't set `_id` in `$set` operations.

* \#1007 Update attribute properly tracks array changes.

## 2.1.4

## 2.1.3

### Resolved Issues

## 2.1.0

### Major Changes

* Mongoid now requires MongoDB 1.8.x in order to properly support the `#bit` and `#rename` atomic operations.

* Traditional slave support has been removed from Mongoid. Replica sets should be used in place of traditional master and slave setups.

* Custom field serialization has changed. Please see [serializable](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/blob/master/lib/mongoid/fields/serializable.rb) for changes.

* The dirty attribute tracking has been switched to use ActiveModel, this brings many bug fixes and changes:

  * \#756 After callbacks and observers see what was changed instead of changes just made being in previous_changes

  * \#434 Documents now are flagged as dirty when brand new or the state on instantiation differs from the database state. This is consistent with ActiveRecord.

  * \#323 Mongoid now supports [field]_will_change! from ActiveModel::Dirty

* Mongoid model preloading in development mode now defaults to `false`.

* `:autosave => true` on relational associations now saves on update as well as create.

### New Features

* \#587 Added order preference to many and many to many associations. (Gregory Man)

* Added ability to chain `order_by` statements. (Gregory Man)

* \#961 Allow arbitrary `Mongo::Connection` options to pass through `Mongoid::Config::Database` object. (Morgan Nelson)

* \#960 create indexes rake task is not recognizing a lot of mongoid models because it has problems guessing their model names from filenames. (Tobias Schlottke)
